## MLP-based Face Recognition with PCA (AI Internship Project)

This project implements a face recognition system leveraging techniques explored during a 1-month AI internship.

* **Objective:** Develop a system for classifying and identifying faces in images.
* **Method:**
    * **Algorithm:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classification.
    * **Pre-processing:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
* **Benefits of PCA:**
    * Improves computational efficiency of the MLP model.
    * Focuses training on key features extracted during PCA.
* **Software:** Jupyter Notebook
